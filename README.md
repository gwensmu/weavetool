# This is a toy project to evaluate Sorbet

I modeled a domain I know well (weaving drafts) to see how Sorbet could help me do that better. It doesn't do much because I don't actually need to automate the process of generating weaving drafts.

## running specs

`rspec`

## running type checks

`srb tc`

## generating a plan
`ruby plan.rb`
